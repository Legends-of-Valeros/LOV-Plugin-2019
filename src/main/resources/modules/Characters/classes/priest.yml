long-description:
- "Skilled in healing others and using curses on enemies."

# ---
# The id of the archetype that this class should use (as it appears in the LevelArchetypes config).
# Archetypes define the base stats for players of this class at different levels.
#
# This archetype must be configured in LevelArchetypes or Characters will not load.
archetype: "player"


# ---
# The base amount damage that this class should deal with melee attacks. This will be heavily affected
# by a player's level, stats, and inventory. The modifiers may be so great that this base level
# is relatively insignificant, but we need a base level either way.
base-melee-damage: 3


# ---
# Define the effects of each strength, stamina, agility, endurance, and intelligence for each
# class. You can configure an arbitrary amount of effects. For example, intelligence could
# increase MANA, MANA_REGEN, and MAGIC_POWER, or it could do nothing for a class if you do
# not configure any effects for it.
#
# Format: <STAT>,<MODIFIER TYPE>,<VALUE PER POINT>
#
# See the CombatEngine Stat Guide for info on what stats can be modified and precisely what
# those stats do. All values here can be decimals (ex: 2.5).  For a full list of CombatEngine's stats, see:
# https://bitbucket.org/legendsofvaleros/combatengine/src/master/src/main/java/com/legendsofvaleros/combatengine/stat/Stat.java?at=master
#
# Acceptable modifier types:
#
#   ADD - Adds a flat value to the stat per point. Use negative values with ADD to subtract
#         per point. Ex: Strength with "PHYSICAL_ATTACK,ADD,10" would add 10 physical attack
#         points per point of Strength.
#
#   ADD_IGNORE_MULTIPLIERS - Adds a flat value to the stat per point. If the player has
#         multipliers applied to the stat in question, the value added/subtracted by this
#         will not be affected.
#
#   MULTIPLY - Multiplies the stat. The amount of the multiplier is defined by the number of
#         points in the class stat.
#
#         The formula for the multiplier is (1 + (valuePerPoint * classStatPoints))
#
#         Ex: Endurance with "MAX_HEALTH,MULTIPLY,0.01" would increase max health by 1% for
#         each point of endurance. If a player had 100 endurance, they would have +100% of
#         their normal health (double). Using this formula, negative values will make a smaller
#         multiplier, though not necessary a negative multiplier. If Intelligence had
#         "MAX_HEALTH,MULTIPLIER,-0.001" it would reduce MAX_HEALTH by 0.1% per point of
#         Intelligence. So, if a player had 100 intelligence, they would have -10% of their
#         normal MAX_HEALTH (90% of its normal total value.
